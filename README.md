# taiko3parser - a parser and viewer for taiko 3's chart format
***NOTE: THIS IS LITERALLY MY FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM THIS IS UNOPTIMIZED TO HELL***
## setting it up
you only need python 3.10+ and the pyglet module  
install it like this  
```
pip install pyglet
```
to run the thing
```
python taiko3parser.py [input file]
```
the input files are charts extracted from taiko 3's data  
taiko 4, taiko 5, taiko 6 and taiko RT chart files are also compatible, as the format itself is the same
